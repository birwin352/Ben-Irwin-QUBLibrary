I sincerely apolgise for this being so awkward to run. I did not realise that certain parts of the project wouldn't run as they were supposed to until after I'd already sent the git link.  I spent hours fighting with git hub to try and make it work to but it was to no avail.  The working version is on eclipse on my laptop but I cannot for the life of me get that onto Git for some reason.

# QUB Library Console Application

This project is a Java console application developed for the CSC1029 module. It models a simple library system, including Books, Lending status, and user interaction through a menu.

##  CRITICAL SETUP INSTRUCTIONS (MUST READ)

Due to version control issues, the repository structure currently uploaded **does not match the required Java package structure.** To ensure the project runs correctly in your IDE, please perform these **two mandatory steps** immediately after cloning:

### Step 1: Fix the Source Folder Name

1.  Locate the source code folder, which is currently named **`Source files`**.
2.  **Rename** this folder from **`Source files`** to **`src`**.

### Step 2: Set Up the Package Structure

1.  In your IDE (Eclipse, IntelliJ, etc.), open the project.
2.  Within the newly renamed **`src`** folder, **create a new Java package** named **`part2`**.
3.  **Drag and drop** all the `.java` files (e.g., `Book.java`, `QUBLibraryUpdated.java`) from the `src` folder directly into the new **`part2`** package folder.

##  How to Run the Application

Once the structure is corrected (Step 2 completed), the project is ready to run:

1.  Locate the main entry point: **`QUBLibraryUpdated.java`** (inside the `part2` package).
2.  **Right-click** on the file's name.
3.  Select **Run As** → **Java Application**.

## 📝 Key Components

The entry point for the application is the `main` method located in **`QUBLibraryUpdated.java`**. The application will launch and display the main menu in a custom console window.
